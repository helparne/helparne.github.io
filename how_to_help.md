* Reach out to the Norwegian Embassy in Argentina's [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/NoruegaenARG), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/EmbajadaDeNoruegaEnArgentina/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/noruegaargentina) accounts to show the World how this Embassy takes care of Norwegian citizens abroad.

* Tell the [Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](Ine.Eriksen.Soreide@mfa.no) to exercise her authority over the Norwegian Embassy so they comply with their written commitment!
