## How can I help?

* <a href="https://www.change.org/p/norwegian-embassy-in-argentina-return-medical-coverage-to-a-norwegian-citizen-in-argentina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign the petition</a> and share it!

* Share [helpArne.org](https://helparne.org), our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/helparne) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/helparnenow) accounts!

* Reach out to [Ambassador Lars Vaagen](Lars.Ole.Vaagen@mfa.no) and [consul Mona Budal](Mona.Helen.Budal@mfa.no) to explain them that what they are doing is not OK!

* Reach out to the Norwegian Embassy in Argentina's [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/NoruegaenARG), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/EmbajadaDeNoruegaEnArgentina/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/noruegaargentina) accounts to show the World how this Embassy takes care of Norwegian citizens abroad.

* Tell the [Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](Ine.Eriksen.Soreide@mfa.no) to exercise her authority over the Norwegian Embassy so they comply with their written commitment!

* Were you or someone you know also a victim of Norwegian Ambassador Lars Vaagen? [Contact us](hi@helpArne.org).

* More to come!
